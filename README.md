# Welcome to the Fantastic Engine template!

## Goodies included

This template includes the following:

- Remix-authentication with form strategy
- Mantine UI components with an AppShell preconfigured
- Knex and Postgres
- Bcrypt
- User profile, login and logout functions
- A dummy route and navigation bar

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with Mantine already configured with AppShell so that you can start building applications quickly.
